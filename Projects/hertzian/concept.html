	  <i>Hertzian Explorer</i>&nbsp;relates to the notion of &#147;hertzian space&#148;, a term 
        used by designers Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby to refer to the invisible 
		physical space created by electromagnetic radiation radiating from 
		electronic objects. It is also a work that aims to combine art and science
		by making the invisible more visible. 
	<br />
	<br />
	  Electromagnetic field meters are used to measure the intensity of  
        radiation from electronic devices and generate unique visualizations of 
		hertzian space. 
	  Different field strengths, their spatial arrangement, 
        and duration of radiation will influence the visual result. Celluar 
        automata and generative designs will reflect
        the changing and diverse nature of hertzian space and 
        also explore the relations in this ecology of hertzian space and virtual 
        organisms. Inviting interaction is another key element of this installation. 
		A video feed of the user's face is distorted based on the intensity and 
		duration of exposure to mobile phone radiation. The user can choose to 
		continue to watch his or her "face" being transformed or stop the phone call. 
	 <br />
	 <br />
	  To highlight the illusive and unconventional nature of hertzian space,
	  this project also incorporates a sculptural aspect consisting of an array of EMF 
	  meters attached to webcams suspensed in midair. The unorthodox juxtaposition of
	  webcams to the emf meters reflects both the strangeness of hertzian space and
	  the difficulty of perceiving it. It reflects the fact that in order
	  to <i>see</i> hertzian space, we need to look at it <i>indirectly</i> through 
	  instrumentation. These elements of sculptural interest gives clues as 
	  to how the piece technially works, creating more involvement and interaction 
	  with the piece. 
    <br />
	<br />
	  By bringing to the human scale electronic signals and radiation, the 
        work hopes to help people discover a new perspective on this mysterious 
        but now permanent aspect of our contemporary world, a world immersed in 
        the fleeting and invisible waves of information flow.
