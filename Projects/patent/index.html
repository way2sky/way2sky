    <p> A patent for a modular reconfigurable wrist watch design. Removable band 
      pieces allow various permutations of the device, giving the user freedom 
      to remix features and there locations relative to the wrist
	  for different occasions and needs.

	  A similar concept involving modular UI design and tangible
	  lego-like electronic pieces is David Merrill's 
	  <a class="patentPage" href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~dmerrill/siftables.html" 
	  target="_blank">"Siftables"</a> developed at the MIT Media Lab.

    <p> Like the 
	customizable watch, this interaction platform emphasizes physical interaction. 
	Siftables involves moving and rearranging multiple small devices into groupings 
	to perform a wide array of digital media and information processing tasks.

	Some history. The plenty of time I had during junior high school allowed me to make best friends with 
	the likes of Popular Science and PC Magazine. Later, in 2003, I sketched up the initial design of the watch.  
	Desperately wanting to see this worn on people's wrists, I thought it would be cool and I sent the patent 
	to Steve Jobs. I never thought about money stuff at that time. 
	
	But in reply to my enthusiasm and youthful naivete, Apple's legal department mailed a letter to me explaining that 
	they don't take unsolicited ideas. Oops.
