(2010) The Quiver is a compact wearable audio system that explores how location 
dependent sound and music can alter the perception of space. 
</br>
</br> 
It was created as part of work at Mark Bolas' Mixed Reality Lab (MxR) at the USC Institute for 
Creative Technologies. This research project explored aspects of psychophysics, signal processing and 
location aware media. Development was informed by research on acoustics and physical computing.
</br>
</br> 
Using a high quality Alum/Mg 3 inch diameter full range driver in a custom enclosure,  
the system provides portability and rich sound. 

Inside the enclosure is a "Class-D" electronic amplifier and an Arduino microcontroller.

Additional GPS and audio playback printed circuit expansion boards (shields) were integrated with 
the Arduino. Custom Arduino programming was done to 
allow the speaker to determine its location and respond by 
playing the appropriate sound file from Secure Digital storage. This work opens up further 
possibilities for exploring locative audio.
</br>
</br>
Quiver has an integrated carrying strap, and relates to the olden days of boom-boxes and the
social practices and implications of altering sound in a public environment. 
</br>
</br> 
It is impossible to truly convey the audio quality here and describing how loudspeakers sound is 
often filled with poetic but meaningless descriptors. Some listeners say that it sounds "immersive" and 
that the low frequency reproduction is unexpectedly rich for its size. Their is also an "umbrella" effect 
in that the sound seems to rise up and cover a 360 degree area. 
The speaker enclosure underwent many iterations to achieve this sound quality.
