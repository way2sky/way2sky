    <br />Our project group was curious if there was some universal time in the day that on average the global P2P community would be seeding or leeching higher or lower than at other times. Questions such as does the time of day have any real impact in the sharing or leeching of files, and if so what could this mean?  For example, did Europeans more often than not leech “software” at night their time more than Americans our time? From our immediate but geospatially-limited knowledge, our group assumed that most P2P usage here in America occurs in the night-time most likely between 18:00-23:00. So while we all had some local common understanding for how and when the P2P community was active, we were quite naive on a global scale.</p>

    <br />For our collected data, we found that most of the P2P data came from North America (specifically the United States) and Europe. Some information was collected from South America and Asia and very little at all was collected for Australia and Africa. The greatest seeder/leecher ratio was from North America and Europe for all three movies, thus confirming our initial conceptions of P2P activity hotspots. For Baby Mama, the ratio was also very high in South America, Asia, and Africa. Australia and Asia ratios were significant for Diving Bell and How to Rob a Bank. For the global up-loader over down-loader ratio, we discovered that the highest ratios occur from 8 am to 1pm and from 9 pm to 7 am of the subsequent day.</p>
