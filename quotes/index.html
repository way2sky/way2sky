	"the best way to predict the future is to invent it."
	
	<br />
	<br />
	-Alan Kay

	</p>

	
	<p class="quoteText">
	
	"Machines that fit the human environment, instead of forcing humans to enter 
	theirs, will make using a computer as refreshing as taking a walk in the woods."
	<br />
	<br />
	-Mark Weiser

	</p>
	

	<p class="quoteText">
	"Modern creatives who want to work in good faith will have to fully disengage 
	from the older generation’s mythos of phantoms, and masterfully grasp the genuine nature 
	of their own creative tools and platforms. Otherwise, they will lack comprehension and command of 
	what they are doing and creating, and they will remain reduced to the freak-show position of 
	most twentieth century tech art. That’s what is at stake."
	<br />
	<br />
	-Bruce Sterling

	</p>
	
	<p class="quoteText">
	“We don't know who discovered water, but we know it wasn't the fish.”
	<br />
	<br />
	-Marshall McLuhan

	</p>
	
	<p class="quoteText">

	"The distinctly cinematic nature of Oshii’s poetics comes out most strongly in the elaborate 
	montage sequences that occur at least once in each of his films from Patlabor onwards. 
	These dialogue-free sequences are filled with shots of spaces and characters that, while 
	only tangentially related to the main narrative, encapsulate the overall thematic 
	and aesthetic concerns of the given film, recasting them in an abstract, symbolic key."
	<br />
	<br />
	-Richard Suchenski on Director Mamoru Oshii	
	</p>
	
	<p class="quoteText">
	"How many colors are there in a field of grass to the crawling baby unaware of 'Green'?"
	<br />
	<br />
	-Stan Brakhage
	</p>
	
	<p class="quoteText">
	“Now to consult the rules of composition before making a picture is a little like 
	consulting the law of gravitation before going for a walk. Such rules and laws are 
	deduced from the accomplished fact; they are the products of reflection.”
	<br />
	<br />
	-Edward Weston
	</p>
	
	<p class="quoteText">
	“History doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme.”
	<br />
	<br />
	-Mark Twain 
	</p>
	
    <p class="quoteText">
	"Quality happens only if somebody has the responsibility for it, and that "somebody" can be no more than one single person—with an exception for a dynamic duo"

	"The aim of art is to represent not the outward appearance of things, but their inward significance."
	<br />
	<br />
	-Aristotle 
	</p>

	<p class="quoteText">
	"There's a world of difference between the ability to recognize discomfort, and the skills, tools, and training needed to alleviate it."
	<br />
	<br />
	-Alan Cooper
	</p>
	
	<p class="quoteText">
	"Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less."
